I analyzed U.S. COVID-19 data from January to July 2020 and observed a significant number of confirmed cases, particularly in New York and California. These states also recorded a high fatality rate relative to confirmed cases. Additionally, both the number of confirmed cases and deaths showed a sharp increase over time. This trend is clearly illustrated in the histogram, which highlights the rapid rise in cases and fatalities during this period.
